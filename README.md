# Microscopic calculation of Hubbard parameters for ultracold atoms for quantum gas microscopes
 Calculation of the Hubbard on-site interaction U for cold atoms for quantum gas microscopes. This package is written in *Mathematica* and is currently limited to quasi-1D and quasi-2D square optical lattices.
 
 ## Getting started
 To begin decide on the relevant package:
 - *1DHubbardParameters* for quasi-1D optical lattices
 - *2DHubbardParameters* for quasi-2D square optical lattices

Download the relevant package and then the package can then be loaded using
```
Get[<path-to-BernDirac.wl>];
```
